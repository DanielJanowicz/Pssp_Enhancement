# Pssp_Enhancement

This iteration of the patient portal buildings upon the currently [existing build](https://github.com/DanielJanowicz/PssP); however, there are a few new additions and modifications that were made: 

- Updated lander (Asthetic)
- Login/Registration functionality
*This includes patient, provider, and administrator*
- Account functionality
- Ability for select account types to modify information (i.e. provider --> patient)

Backend SQLserver was updated to accomodate the registration and saving of credentials.

## Known issues:
Experience with connection patient_conditions to the site due to problems with SQL and defining the foreign key.  This has been an established issue since the first iteration of PssP.

Updating account details prompts an error (username and/or email)
